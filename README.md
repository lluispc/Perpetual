Perpetual API Perpetual is an API written in Python using Rust's autonomi bindings. This application acts as a bridge between different programming languages and the Autonomi network.

The system is composed of a general API and two submodules:

Main API: Handles files, directories, and wallet operations.

Etherscan Monitor: Connects to the Etherscan API to monitor transactions.

Task Generator: Responsible for creating and managing asynchronous tasks.

Architecture The application is structured using Docker containers:

api: Hosts the main API service.

worker: Handles background task execution.

broker: Manages message brokering between components.

This modular structure allows seamless interoperability and scalability across components and languages.
